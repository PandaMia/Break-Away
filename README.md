# Break-Away

![](https://github.com/PandaMia/Break-Away/blob/master/Assets/Sprites/menu/menu.png)

Side-scroller game created for the game jam.

Smart houses became too much smart.  
In such a house you don't even feel like you're in a prison â€“ you feel like you've been eaten alive.  
You've decided to run away on jetpack. The only one way to break away from the city is to run to the outskirts and fly away.  
You don't have a jetpack and House didn't like your escape. But there is no way back and and you will have to collect it on the run.
